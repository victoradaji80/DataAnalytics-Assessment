-- ========================================
-- ðŸ‘€ Business Use Case:
-- Identify active savings or investment accounts with no inflow in the past 365 days
-- to enable re-engagement, churn prevention, or inactivity risk flagging.
-- ========================================

WITH last_inflow_dates AS (
    -- Step 1: Get last inflow per plan (confirmed deposit only)
    SELECT

        s.plan_id,
        MAX(s.transaction_date) AS last_transaction_date

        DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), l.last_transaction_date) AS inactivity_days
    FROM last_inflow_dates l
    WHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), l.last_transaction_date) > 365

    SELECT

            ELSE 'Other'
        END AS plan_type
    FROM plans_plan

-- Step 4: Join inactive accounts with plan type and optionally customer names
SELECT
